# nets-ucsd-python-workshop-2022/2023

Being an engineering student, chances are you know Python or have heard about Python and its growing versatility in the scientific and engineering community. In the NANO curriculum alone, NANO courses such as 110, 114, and 181 often expect students to do a lot of coding as homework. Outside academics, Python is among the most hirable skills for engineering and research positions. With these reasons in mind, we are proud to present this 2-day Python in Materials Science workshop that we hope will give you some exposure to the miracles of Python and help you achieve academic and career success. 

In the first session, we will review the basics of Python to help you transfer your MATLAB knowledge to Python. You can expect to leave this first session with three main takeaways: 
<ol>
  <li>Knowing how to create a Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Familiarity with the standard Python libraries and how they are used for data processing and visualization</li>
  <li>Having a rudimentary understanding of correlation-based clustering algorithms</li>
</ol>

**Python Folder to Check**: *Day-1-Getting Started and Data Processing in Python*\
**Topic Leader**: Duc Tran and Mai Her

In the second session, we invite current students who are doing computational research at UCSD to showcase how they use Python in their day-to-day research life and give instructive Python examples. The main takeaways of the second session are:
<ol>
  <li>Working with APIs to acquire data from public databases</li>
  <li>Creating supervised machine learning models</li>
  <li>Productizing your Python program by turning it into a website application...using Python</li>
</ol>

**Python Folder to Check**: *Day-2-Python Applications in Materials Science Showcase*\
**Topic Leader**: Mai Her, Ethan Doan, and Duc Tran

In the third session, we review the fundamentals presented in the first session, and touch on object-oriented programming in Python. A more in-depth discussion about machine learning in Python is also provided. We touched on the needs for regularization for linear regression model, and then showcase the use of a neural network model for materials science application. The main takeaways of the third session are:
<ol>
  <li>Creating classes and objects in Python</li>
  <li>Understanding the steps to train a machine learning model</li>
  <li>Gaining familiarity with Linear, Ridge Regression, and Tensorflow</li>
</ol>

**Python Folder to Check**: *Day-3-Objects-Classes-Supervised-ML*\
**Topic Leader**: Ethan Doan and Mai Her

In the fourth session, we discuss the importance of productizing ML models in science and engineering. A simple Python Streamllit template is provided to help you create your first website application. Secondly, we discuss how to use Pycalphad to take public multicomponent property data and generate phase diagrams and other meaningful plots to assist you in your research. The main takeaways of the fourth session are:

<ol>
  <li>Understanding the need for productizing your Python work using a website application</li>
  <li>Building your first website application using Streamlit</li>
  <li>Knowing the steps needed to generate materials phase diagrams and plot other thermodynamic properties using Pycalphad</li>
</ol>
