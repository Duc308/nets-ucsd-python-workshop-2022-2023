# nets-ucsd-python-workshop-2022/2023

Being an engineering student, chances are you know Python or have heard about Python and its growing versatility in the scientific and engineering community. In the NANO curriculum alone, NANO courses such as 110, 114, and 181 often expect students to do a lot of coding as homework. Outside academics, Python is among the most hirable skills for engineering and research positions. With these reasons in mind, we are proud to present this 2-day Python in Materials Science workshop that we hope will give you some exposure to the miracles of Python and help you achieve academic and career success. 

In the first session, we will review the basics of Python to help you transfer your MATLAB knowledge to Python. You can expect to leave this first session with three main takeaways: 
<ol>
  <li>Knowing how to create a Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>Familiarity with the standard Python libraries and how they are used for data processing and visualization</li>
  <li>Having a rudimentary understanding of correlation-based clustering algorithms</li>
</ol>

**Python Folder to Check**: *Day-1-Getting Started and Data Processing in Python*

In the second session, we invite current students who are doing computational research at UCSD to showcase how they use Python in their day-to-day research life and give instructive Python examples. The main points of the second session are: **1. Working with APIs to acquire data from public databases, 2. Creating supervised machine learning models, 3. Productizing your Python program by turning it into a website application...using Python**
