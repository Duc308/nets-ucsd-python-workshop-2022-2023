        "Python `Streamlit` and Python `Dash` are both open-source Python libraries that are used for building interactive web applications in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Streamlit** is a relatively new library that is designed to help data scientists quickly build interactive web applications using Python. It allows users to create data-driven applications in just a few lines of code, without needing to worry about the underlying HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Streamlit provides an easy-to-use API that allows users to create web applications with widgets for input, data visualization, and output. Streamlit is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a great choice for data scientists who want to quickly create interactive visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "https://streamlit.io/gallery\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dash**, on the other hand, is a more mature library that has been around for a few years. It is built on top of Flask, a popular Python web framework, and React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Dash allows users to create interactive web applications by writing Python code. Like Streamlit, Dash provides a set of components for input, data visualization, and output, and also allows users to customize the appearance of their applications using CSS. However, Dash has a steeper learning curve than Streamlit due to its more complex architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "https://dash.gallery/Portal/\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, both Streamlit and Dash are powerful tools for creating interactive web applications in Python, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Streamlit is great for quickly building simple, data-driven applications, while Dash is better suited for more complex applications that require more customization and interactivity."
